They are designed to perform various language-related tasks, such as answering questions, summarizing documents, translating languages, writing different forms of text, and generating code. LLMs have been significantly improved through techniques such as in-context learning, which allows them to temporarily learn from specific prompts.\n",

Effective prompts can guide the model's reasoning, provide context, and specify the desired output. Various prompt engineering techniques have been developed, including chain-of-thought prompting, generated knowledge prompting, and complexity-based prompting, each tailored to specific tasks and models.\n",

            "        \"**Environmental Characteristics**\\n- Pressure: Pressure increases by about 1 atmosphere for every 10 meters of depth. Deep-sea organisms must have adaptations to withstand this pressure.\\n- Salinity: Salinity is remarkably constant throughout the deep sea, with no significant ecological differences.\\n- Temperature: The two areas of greatest temperature gradient are the transition zone between the surface waters and the deep waters (the thermocline) and the transition between the deep-sea floor and the hot water flows at the hydrothermal vents.\\n- Light: Natural light does not penetrate the deep ocean, except for the upper parts of the mesopelagic. Organisms must rely on energy sources from elsewhere, such as organic material drifting down from the photic zone.\\n\\n**Biology**\\n- Regions below the epipelagic are divided into further zones: bathyal zone (200-3000 meters), abyssal zone (3000-6000 meters), and hadal zone (6000-11,000 meters).\\n- Food: Deep-sea organisms rely on falling organic matter known as 'marine snow' and carcasses derived from the productive zone above.\\n- Adaptations: Deep-sea organisms have various adaptations to survive in extreme conditions, including: \\n 1. Jelly-like flesh to provide buoyancy\\n 2. Floaters filled with ammonium chloride that are lighter than the surrounding water\\n 3. Small size, slow metabolism, and elongated bodies\\n 4. Enhanced eyesight, such as larger eyes and rod cells for detecting light in low-light conditions\\n 5. Bioluminescence for camouflage and attracting prey\\n 6. Modifications in proteins, anatomical structures and metabolic systems to cope with high hydrostatic pressure\\n\\n**Chemosynthesis**\\n- Some species in the deep sea do not rely on dissolved organic matter for their food.\\n- These species form communities around hydrothermal vents and rely on chemosynthesis, a process where bacteria use chemical energy to produce organic matter. The tube worm Riftia is an example of an organism that benefits from this process.\\n\\n**Adaptation to Hydrostatic Pressure:**\\n- Deep-sea organisms have developed unique adaptations to survive hydrostatic pressure.\\n- Proteins can be affected by hydrostatic pressure, so deep-sea organisms have specific substitutions in the active sites of proteins like actin.\\n- These substitutions allow for better stabilization in ATP binding and subunit arrangement.\\n- Osmolytes like Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) are adjusted in deep-sea fish to assist in protein stabilization.\\n- Molecular adaptations include modified Osteocalcin genes, which lead to open skulls and cartilage-based bone formation in species like the Mariana hadal snailfish. These adaptations are crucial for withstanding high pressure in the deep sea.\\n\\nBased on:\\n  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea\",\n",

The water is cold and dark, so animals must adapt to the low temperatures and lack of light. The pressure is immense, so animals must develop strong bodies to withstand the crushing force.\\nOne of the most striking adaptations of deep-sea life is the use of bioluminescence. This is the ability to produce light, and it is used by many deep-sea animals to attract prey, communicate with each other, and defend themselves from predators. Bioluminescence is often produced by a chemical reaction that involves a luciferase enzyme and a luciferin substrate.\\nAnother adaptation of deep-sea life is the use of gigantism. This is the tendency for deep-sea animals to be larger than their shallow-water counterparts. Gigantism is thought to be an adaptation to the low food availability in the deep sea. Larger animals have a greater chance of finding food, and they can also store more energy in their bodies.\\nDeep-sea life is a fascinating and diverse group of organisms that have evolved to cope with the extreme conditions of the deep ocean.
